# You can use the @ character at the beginning of a config option to lock it from being edited in-game
# Example usage:
# @SERVERNAME tgstation
# Which sets the SERVERNAME, and disallows admins from being able to change it using View Variables.
# @LOG_TWITTER 0
# Which explicitly disables LOG_TWITTER, as well as locking it.
# There are various options which are hard-locked for security reasons.

# Hashtags at the beginning of lines will not be parsed. This only applies at the beginning of the line.
# If you include a hashtag in a setting like so: MYHEXCOLORCONFIG #FF73D2
# It will still be parsed

## Server name: This appears at the top of the screen in-game. In this case it will read "tgstation: station_name" where station_name is the randomly generated name of the station for the round. Remove the # infront of SERVERNAME and replace 'spacestation13' with the name of your choice

## Unhash this entry to have certain jobs require your account to be at least a certain number of days old to select. You can configure the exact age requirement for different jobs by editing
## the minimal_player_age variable in the files in folder /code/game/jobs/job/.. for the job you want to edit. Set minimal_player_age to 0 to disable age requirement for that job.
## REQUIRES the database set up to work. Keep it hashed if you don't have a database set up.
## NOTE: If you have just set-up the database keep this DISABLED, as player age is determined from the first time they connect to the server with the database up. If you just set it up, it means
## you have noone older than 0 days, since noone has been logged yet. Only turn this on once you have had the database up for 30 days.

## Unhash this entry to have certain antag roles require your account to be at least a certain number of days old for round start and auto-spawn selection.
